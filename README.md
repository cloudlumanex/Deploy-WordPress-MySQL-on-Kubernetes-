# Deploy WordPress MySQL on Kubernetes
This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable, modular two-tier web application WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, showcasing infrastructure as code, container orchestration, and service exposure using Kustomize for maintainable YAML management.

## üß± Architecture

- WordPress frontend
- MySQL backend
- Persistent storage for MySQL
- Kustomize for resource management


## üìÅ Files

- `wordpress-deployment.yaml`: WordPress Deployment + Service
- `mysql-deployment.yaml`: MySQL Deployment + Service
- `kustomization.yaml`: Kustomize overlay


## üîß Key Problems Solved by the Project

| Problem                        | Solution                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-tier application setup**  | Used Kubernetes Deployments and Services to orchestrate the frontend (WordPress) and backend (MySQL) containers. |
| **Manual and inconsistent setup** | Defined infrastructure using version-controlled YAML manifests, enabling reproducibility and automation. |
| **Lack of application portability** | Containerized both WordPress and MySQL, ensuring consistent behavior across local, cloud, and CI/CD environments. |
| **Configuration complexity**       | Leveraged **Kustomize** to organize, customize, and manage Kubernetes resources without duplicating YAML files. |
| **Local development constraints** | Used **Minikube** to simulate a cloud-like Kubernetes environment for local development and testing. |
| **Volatile data storage**         | Configured **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** to ensure MySQL data persists across pod restarts and is decoupled from containers. |


# DevOps Skills Demonstrated
Container orchestration: Running and scaling containers via Kubernetes

Declarative Infrastructure: Managing deployments using YAML

Service exposure: Exposing apps using NodePort or minikube service

Resource management: Using Kustomize to manage layered manifests

Troubleshooting: Diagnosing pod failures (ImagePullBackOff, etc.)

CI/CD potential: The YAML structure is CI/CD-ready (GitHub Actions or Jenkins integration)

# Real-World Relevance
This kind of setup mimics what DevOps engineers do in the real world for:

Deploying CMS platforms

Migrating legacy apps to Kubernetes

Automating infrastructure with IaC

Building development and testing environments quickly
